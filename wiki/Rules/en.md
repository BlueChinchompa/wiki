# Rules

These are the rules that help keep the game and community fun and fair.

# Community Rules

1. **Each user may have only one account EVER!** The only exception to this rule is making bot accounts or other projects, but you must first let staff know so we can approve it. If you have lost your email or password please open a support ticket in the [Titanic discord](https://discord.gg/qryYG2C5nc).
2. **Play fair.** Using any third party tools that give you an unfair advantage over people will result in a restriction. This includes programs like macros, cheat engine, aim-assist programs, timewarp, and so on. If a program is doing something to help you play that you should be doing then it is not okay! If you catch anybody cheating please open up a ticket in the [Titanic discord](https://discord.gg/qryYG2C5nc) server.
3. **Be kind to people.** Any harrassment, racism, or antagonism has no place here in Titanic! This is just a server about clicking circles, catching fruit, bashing drums, and breaking keyboards whilst pretending to be cookiezi and playing old maps, not to be assholes to each other.
